# lab_price_calculator
Shiny app to calculate lab prices

Use in R/RStudio to run the app:

library(shiny)  
runGitHub( "lab_price_calculator", "giuliogiagnoni")

The sample feed price list in the app was taken from https://www.analyticalfeed.com/price.html. 

I will try to make a tutorial video at some point.
